			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>Coding Brum is a coding club for young people under 18, which takes place in the public space at the BBC in the Mailbox in Birmingham City Centre. <br> We cater for coders of all abilities from beginners to experts, and we welcome anybody who wishes to learn how to code to come along!</p>
			<p>Coding Brum is free for all to attend, however participants will have to bring their own hardware or software which they wish to use. <br> If you want to come along to Coding Brum, please email us <a href="mailto:codingbrum@bbc.co.uk?subject=I'm coming along to Coding Brum!">here!</a> so we know how much power and chairs we need to supply.</p>
