		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>Coding Brum is a coding club for young people under 18, which takes place in the public space at the BBC in the Mailbox in Birmingham City Centre. We cater for coders of all abilities from beginners to experts, and we welcome anybody who wishes to learn how to code to come along!</p>
		<p>Coding Brum is free for all to attend, however participants will have to bring their own hardware or software which they wish to use.</p>
